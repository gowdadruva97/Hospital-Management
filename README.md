➡️ Project Description : The Hospital Management System is a software application utilized in hospitals for the management of patient records, billing, and various other services. Here ,Each patient is assigned a unique identification number, and their information is automatically stored within the system. This system facilitates the easy retrieval of available doctors, room statuses, and patient information.Access to the system is restricted to the administrator or receptionist, who can log in and input data using a designated username and password.The system is user-friendly, ensuring that data remains secure and readily accessible. It is beneficial for hospitals of all kinds and aids in enhancing decision-making regarding patient care and hospital administration.The software enhances the quality and efficiency of hospital operations, including billing and diagnostic processes.

➡️ Objectives of the system include:

1.Defining and managing hospital tasks.
2.Recording patient information and diagnoses.
3.Generating bills for services rendered.
4.Monitoring immunization records for children.
5.Storing data related to diseases and medications.

➡️ Existing system constraints (prior to software implementation):

1.Patient information is recorded manually with each visit.
2.Invoices are generated on paper and calculated by hand.
3.Diagnosis documentation is discarded after a certain period.
4.Immunization records are maintained in physical files.
5.Physicians depend on recollection to associate medications with illnesses.
